ImageUploader 1.0  

To work with it simply clone repository to your IDE  
ImageUploader allows us to upload image of format jpg and png  
For now we have 3 level of User: Basic, Premium and Enterprise their attributes can be checked in imageuploader/images/serializers.py  
You can easily check all user with username Basic/Premium/Enterpriseuser like: BasicUser and password: {userlevel}54321  
To add new Userlevels simply ass them to Serializers and change view  

That is all for now. Thanks for reading.
