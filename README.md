ImageUploader 1.0  

To work with it simply clone repository to your IDE  
ImageUploader allows us to upload image of format jpg and png  
For now we have 3 level of User: Basic, Premium and Enterprise their attributes can be checked in imageuploader/images/serializers.py  
You can easily check all user with username Basic/Premium/Enterpriseuser like: BasicUser and password: {userlevel}54321  
To add new Userlevels simply ass them to Serializers and change view  

py_client is for testing the modules of API but unfortunately for now It won't work properly but will be fixed in next days 

That is all for now. Thanks for reading.
